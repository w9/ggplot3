ZP: 3D scatter plot
===================

ZP leverages **WebGL** and implements **relational-data plotting language** (similar to `ggplot2` in R),
presenting an elegant way to present data points with interactive 3D graphics.

A simple R interface is included but the plotting functions can be bound to Python, Julia or other languages easily.

Features
--------

* WebGL interactive 3D graphics
* ggplot2-like relational data language
* allows for picking data dynamically
* allows for adjusting of aspect ratio
